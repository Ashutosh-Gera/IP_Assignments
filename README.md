#  <p align = center> IP_Assignments </p>
> A collection of all the assignments done by me as a part of the CSE-101 [Intro to Programming] course in Winter'22 at IIIT Delhi under Prof. Pankaj Jalote

To Navigate, each directory, namely Assignment 1/2/3, consists of a .pdf file inside it which has the collection of the questions whose python solutions are
present in that directory. The naming convention for each .py file follows the format: "A[assignmentNumber]-2021026-[quesNumber].py".

Assignment 1: Based on basic python logical and functional programming.

Assignment 2: Based on high order logics and File Input/Outputs in python.

Assignment 3: Based on Object-oriented programming in python.

Inside the directory "API Assignment" is a group project (group of 3) present which was made as a part of a bonus assignment given to us.

**Details about our project:**
It is a basically a movie-search engine made using basic html, css and javascript. You can clone that folder and run the main.html file to see the website!
